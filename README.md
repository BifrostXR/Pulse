# Bifrost Pulse Driver

**Beta driver** for the Pulse haptic glove. This driver operates by emulating Knuckles controllers, enabling seamless integration of Pulse for titles that lack native support. Additionally, it offers basic haptic feedback, enhancing your experience with vibrations and subtle force feedback*.

**Proper force feedback requires native support and thus, is not fully enabled for non-native applications.*
